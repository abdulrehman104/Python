#  Variables:
#  variables are used to store data values. A variable is essentially a name that refers to a value. You don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly in Python; the type is determined dynamically based on the value assigned to it. Here's an overview of variables in Python, including how to create them, naming conventions, and some examples.



# Creating Variables
# You create a variable by assigning a value to it using the = operator.

my_Name = "AbdulRehman"
print(my_Name)



## Data Types:

# Python has several built-in data types that can be categorized as follows:

# - str: String, e.g., "hello"
# - int: Integer, e.g., 42
# - float: Floating point number, e.g., 3.14
# - bool: Boolean, e.g., True or False
# - NoneType: Represents the absence of a value, e.g., None


# Creating variables
x = 10         # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "Alice" # String
is_valid = True # Boolean
i = None # None

print(x)
print(y)
print(name)
print(is_valid)
print(type(i))
